Implementation of the beanstalkd work queue in Go

This is my fork for me to:

- Learn more about the internals of Beanstalkd and how it works (Go port)
- Benchmark go-beanstalkd against beanstalkd
- Add some features to go-beanstalkd that beanstalkd lacks e.g. atomic move, put-unique
- Experiment with including go-beanstalk in other projects e.g non-public socket; maybe channels instead of sockets?

Anyways, it's fun time.
